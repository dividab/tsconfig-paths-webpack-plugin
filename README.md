Use this to load modules whose location is specified in the `paths` section of
`tsconfig.json` when using webpack. This package provides the functionality of
the [tsconfig-paths](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tsconfig-paths) package but
as a webpack plug-in.

## How to install

```
yarn add --dev tsconfig-paths-webpack-plugin
```

or

```
npm install --save-dev tsconfig-paths-webpack-plugin
```

## How to use

In your webpack config add this:

```js
const TsconfigPathsPlugin = require('tsconfig-paths-webpack-plugin');

module.exports = {
  ...
  resolve: {
    plugins: [new TsconfigPathsPlugin({ /*configFile: "./path/to/tsconfig.json" */ })]
  }
  ...
}
```

> Notice that the plugin is placed in the `resolve.plugins` section of the configuration. `tsconfig-paths-webpack-plugin` is a resolve plugin and should only be placed in this part of the configuration. Don't confuse this with the plugins array at the root of the webpack configuration object.

## Options

#### configFile _(string) (default='tsconfig.json')_

Allows you to specify where to find the TypeScript configuration file.

You may provide

* just a file name. The plugin will search for the filename using the built-in
  logic in the `tsconfig-paths` package. The search will start at `cwd`.
* a relative path to the configuration file. It will be resolved relative to
  `cwd`.
* an absolute path to the configuration file.

> The use of `cwd` as default above is not optimal but we've found no better
> solution yet. If you have a suggestion please file an issue.

#### extensions _(string[]) (default=[".ts", ".tsx"])_

An array of the extensions that will be tried during resolve. Ideally this would be the same as the extensions form the webpack config but it seems resolver plug-ins does not have access to this infomration so you need to specify it again for the plugin.

#### baseUrl _(string) (default=undefined)_

This allows you to override the `baseUrl` found in tsconfig.json. The baseUrl specifies from which directory `paths` should be resolved. So this option enabled you to resolve from anhother directory than the one where tsconfig.json is located. This can be useful if you want to use webpack with `tsc --watch` instead of a typescript loader. If this option is `undefined` then the `baseUrl` from tsconfig.json will be used.

#### silent _(boolean) (default=false)_

If true, no console.log messages will be emitted. Note that most error messages
are emitted via webpack which is not affected by this flag.

#### logLevel _(string) (default=warn)_

Can be `info`, `warn` or `error` which limits the log output to the specified
log level. Beware of the fact that errors are written to stderr and everything
else is written to stderr (or stdout if logInfoToStdOut is true).

#### colors _(boolean) (default=true)_

If `false`, disables built-in colors in logger messages.

#### logInfoToStdOut _(boolean) (default=false)_

This is important if you read from stdout or stderr and for proper error
handling. The default value ensures that you can read from stdout e.g. via pipes
or you use webpack -j to generate json output.
